Abstraction is your friend. Rather than stuffing your views with conditionals, you should pass your views any sub-views you wish to be included in the output. Your view doesn't need to know the inner workings of these sub-views, and you can swap them out depending on whether the user is a normal user or a guest user.

Here's a simplistic example:

class View {
    /** Does some view stuff... */

    public function addSubview($name, Subview $subview) {
        //store subviews to be used in the template
    }
}

/** 
 * Somewhere in a controller far far away...
 */
class GuestController extends Controller {
    /** Does some controllery stuff... */

    public function exec() {
        //..
        //prepare the view
        $this->view->addSubview('toolbar', $guestToolbarSubview);
    }
}
